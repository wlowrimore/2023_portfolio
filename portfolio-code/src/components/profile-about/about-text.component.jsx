    <Text>
      I am a graduate of Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
      Upon completion of the course I received my certification in web
      development utilizing the M.E.R.N Stack. Through the program, I studied
      and implemented a variety of front-end and back-end skills. I have
      continued my education through other courses so as to maintain and gain
      more widespread knowledge across the software development spectrum.
      <br />
      <br />
      One of the most important things I learned as a student in the bootcamp is
      how to be persistent in problem solving. I write code daily, and everyday
      I am met with a new wall to get over, a new hurdle to clear. When I meet
      that challenge, and solve that problem, I am reminded of how being so
      persistent pays off and how rewarding it is.
      <br />
      <br />
      Coding began as a career change for me, but unexpectedly became a passion.
      As a former professional musician, having a passion for something that
      yields a fruitful result is not a foreign concept to me. I love to code. I
      love to learn. I love being challenged, and I love to create.
